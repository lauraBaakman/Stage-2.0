% Introduction
\noindent Kernel density estimation has gained popularity in the past few years. 
% Method
Generally the methods use symmetric kernels, even though the data of which the density is estimated are not necessarily spread equally in all dimensions. To account for this asymmetric distribution of data we propose the use of shape adaptive kernels: kernels whose shape changes to fit the spread of the data in the local neighborhood of the point whose density is estimated.
% Experiment
We compare the performance of the shape adaptive kernels on simulated datasets with known density fields.
