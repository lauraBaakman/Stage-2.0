% Introduction
\noindent Kernel density estimation has won in popularity in the past few years. 
% Method
Generally symmetric kernels are used, even though the data of which the density is estimated are not necessarily spread equally in all dimensions. To account for this asymmetric distribution of data we propose the use of shape adaptive kernels: kernels whose shape changes to fit the spread of the data in the local neighborhood of the point of which the density is estimated.
% Experiment
We compare the performance of the shape adaptive kernels on both artificial and real world datasets with the performance of symmetric kernels on the unprocessed datasets and on the whitened datasets.
