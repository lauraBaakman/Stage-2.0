We compare the performance of the shape-adaptive with that of the adaptive-width method it is based on, \ie the Modified Breiman Estimator. \Cref{ss:3:datasets} introduces the datasets we use for our experiments. The metrics used to compare the performance of the different estimators are introduced in \cref{ss:3:errorMeasures}.

\subsection{Datasets}
\label{ss:3:datasets}
	The performance of the estimators is investigated with two groups of datasets: a number of simulated datasets with known density fields and a real world dataset with an unknown density field. The simulated datasets allow us to test how well a method can recover simple density distributions. Whereas the real world dataset make it possible to compare the performance of the estimators in the context in which they would be applied.
