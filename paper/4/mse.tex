\Cref{tab:4:results:mse} presents the mean squared error of the different dataset for the two estimators. Comparing the two columns of mean squared errors we find that the Modified Breiman Estimator outperforms the shape-adaptive variant on every dataset. 

The differences in MSE between the two datasets on dataset \ferdosiOne is negligible. On dataset \ferdosiTwo, and \ferdosiFive, the performances of the estimators differ more, but the results are comparable. The biggest difference in performance is found when comparing the results of the estimators on dataset \baakmanOne, \baakmanFour, and \baakmanFive.
