This section presents a visual representation of the results of the estimators that allows us to compare the performance of the two estimators on a single dataset. All plots associated with a single dataset have the same axes. The horizontal axis is used to represent the known densities, this axis has the same range as the known densities. The estimated densities are shown on the vertical axis, the length of these axes is such that they are long enough to represent every estimated density for that dataset, independent of the used estimator. The black line in each plot illustrates the line all points would lie on if a perfect estimator was used, \ie the line $x = x$. The colors of the points in these plot correspond to the colors of the elements of the datasets in \cref{tab:3:simulated:datasets} and \cref{fig:3:simulated:datasets}. \Cref{s:results:plots:singleGaussian} is concerned with the results of the datasets that contain only a single Gaussian, \ie dataset \ferdosiOne, \baakmanOne, \baakmanFour, \baakmanFive. The results for the datasets with multiple Gaussian distributions, \ie dataset \ferdosiTwo, \baakmanTwo, \ferdosiThree, \baakmanThree, are presented in \cref{s:results:plots:multipleGaussians}.
