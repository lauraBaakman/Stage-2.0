This section presents a visual comparison of the results of the estimators that allows us to contrast the performance of the two estimators on a single dataset. 
% Axes
All plots associated with a single dataset have the same domain and range, to allow for easy comparison of the results within a dataset. The horizontal axis is used to represent the known densities, its range is such that each known density can be shown. The estimated densities are shown on the vertical axis, the length of these axes is such that they are long enough to represent every estimated density for that dataset, independent of the used estimator. 
% Perfect performance line
The black line in each plot illustrates the line all points would lie on if a perfect estimator was used, \ie the line $x = x$.
% Colors
The colors of the points in these plot correspond to the colors of the elements of the datasets in \cref{tab:3:simulated:datasets} and \cref{fig:3:simulated:datasets}. 
% Introduce the subsections
\Cref{s:results:plots:singleGaussian} is concerned with the results of the datasets that contain only a single Gaussian, \ie dataset \ferdosiOne, \baakmanOne, \baakmanFour, and \baakmanFive. The results for the datasets with multiple Gaussian distributions, \ie dataset \ferdosiTwo, \baakmanTwo, \ferdosiThree, and \baakmanThree, are presented in \cref{s:results:plots:multipleGaussians}.
