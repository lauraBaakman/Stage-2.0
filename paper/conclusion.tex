\todo[inline]{Determine the optimal value of k.}

\todo[inline]{What does the boundary effect do if the noise is not uniformly randomly sampled?}

\todo[inline]{Further research: If the k-nearest neighbor is more than some distance x away from xi the identity matrix, or better, move between the fixed-width kernel and the shape-adaptive kernel based on the distance of the k-nearest neighbor.}
