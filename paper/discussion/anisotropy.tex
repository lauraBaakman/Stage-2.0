% Small differences in anisotropy  
	% Where are the differeneces largest -> plots
	% Refer to earlier solutions

% Highest anisotropy of noise component 
	% Kernel 'catches' spurious structures in noise -> increase K.

% 	  Denser component -> higher anisotropy of kernels
% AND Higher anistropy in component -> higer anisotropy in associated kernels
% AND Denser comonent -> lower MSE
	% Introduce the dataset A1 and A2, same anisotropy different density, what do we observe, what does it say about this correlation.

% Lack of difference in anisotropy between F3 and B3 in orange (‘Trivariate Gaussian 3’) component.
