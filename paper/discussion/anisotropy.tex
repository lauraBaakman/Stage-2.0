			\Cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:singleSphere} shows the datasets with a single Gaussian with points whose anisotropy lie in the \nth{90} percentile emphasized. 
				% Ferdosi 1 & Baakman 1
				Hardly any differences are visible between the plots of dataset \ferdosiOne and \baakmanOne. 
					% Very few points from Gaussian comonent
					In \cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:ferdosi1,fig:discussion:anisotropy:baakman1} \percentage{5.180481283422460e-01} and \percentage{1.174799465240642e+01}, respectively, of the emphasized points are sampled from the Gaussian component of the datasets. Illustrating that the kernels in dataset \baakmanOne are influenced by the increased anisotropy of the Gaussian component, compared to the component used in dataset \ferdosiOne.
					% Shell of points sampled from the noise around the Gaussian comonent
					Furthermore a shell of points sampled from the noise with kernels whose anisotropy is relatively high surrounds the Gaussian component. It is quite likely that the shape of the kernel of these points is influenced by that component. 
					% Explanation: high density -> anisotropy detection fails
					We expect that nearer to the mean of the Gaussian component fewer kernels are influenced by its anisotropy as the physical density of points is quite high in that area. Consequently the volume of the local neighborhood is insufficient to represent the shape of the Gaussian.
				% Baakman 4 and 5
				In dataset \baakmanFour and \baakmanFive a larger percentage of the points with a kernel whose anisotropy is relatively high is sampled from the Gaussian component, \percentage{2.190842245989305e+01} and \percentage{4.207887700534759e+01}, respectively. 
				% Conclusion
				Therefore we tentatively conclude that as the anisotropy of the Gaussian component increases, the anisotropy of the kernels of the points near that component increase as well.

		% General Introduction
		\Cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:multisphere} emphasizes the points with the most anisotropic kernels in dataset \ferdosiTwo through \baakmanThree. 
		% Ferdosi 2
			% Same observations as for ferdosi 1, present percentages
			In the plot associated with dataset \ferdosiTwo we observe the same shells of high anisotropy kernels around the Gaussian components as in dataset \ferdosiOne. Another similarity between these two datasets is that very few points sampled from the Gaussian component have a kernel with high anisotropy; \percentage{1.453877} and \percentage{0.1169786} of the points with a high anisotropy are sampled from the first and second Gaussian component, respectively. 
			% F2G1 vs F2G2
			We contribute the difference in the number of highly anisotropic kernels associated with data points sampled from the two Gaussian components to the difference in the volume of the their eigenspheres.
		% Baakman 2
			% More points near the Gaussian anisotropic
			Comparing \cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:ferdosi2,fig:discussion:anisotropy:baakman2} we find that the increase in anisotropy of the components causes \percentage{4.328209} and \percentage{8.656417} of the kernels with high anisotropy to be associated with a point sampled from `Trivariate Gaussian 1' and 2, respectively. 
		% Ferdosi 3
			% G1 and G3 have anisotropic kernels. 
			Interestingly in dataset \ferdosiThree, two of the four spherical Gaussians, \ie `Trivariate Gaussian ' are associated with respectively \percentage{1.404095} and \percentage{2.223151} of the highly anisotropic kernels.
			% Relate to results: components with highest sd, lowest means, lower density -> larger variation in anisotropy
			Comparing the mean kernel anisotropy in \cref{tab:results:multiSphere:anisotropy} we find that compared to the other Gaussian components in \ferdosiThree, these two components have a relatively low mean anisotropy. However their standard deviations are higher, suggesting that in these components some kernels are extremely anisotropic, whereas others are near isotropic. We contribute this difference within the points sampled from a Gaussian component to difference in physical density of the data points nearer to the mean, as we did for dataset \ferdosiOne and \baakmanOne.
			% Why G1 and G3 and not G2 and G4? 
			Component one and four of dataset \ferdosiThree differ from the other Gaussian components in two aspects: firstly the volume of their eigenspheres is relatively low and secondly they are placed near the boundaries of the dataset. 
				% G1/G3 are placed near the  border of the dataset, contrast with results of F3Noise?
				\Cref{fig:discussion:ferdosi3Noise:anisotropy} shows that distance to the boundaries do not explain the difference in anisotropy of the kernel as in that figure the first and third component of \ferdosiThreeNoise have more anisotropic kernels than the other components, even though they are farther away from the boundary of the dataset.
				% G1/G3 have lower covariance:
				The first explanation fits with the observations from \cref{s:results} that components with eigensphere with a larger volume have kernels that have a higher anisotropy.
		% Baakman 3
			In dataset \baakmanThree we observe the same effect as in \ferdosiThree but stronger; from the points with the most anisotropic kernels more are sampled from the two densest Gaussian component than from the others. 

	% Some general conclusion
	\Cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:singleSphere,fig:discussion:anisotropy:multisphere} show that the overwhelming majority of the points with a relative highly anisotropic kernel are sampled from the `Uniform random background'. We contribute this to the covariance detecting fine, random structures in the noise, that give the impression of anisotropy where there is none.

% Denser component -> higher anisotropy of kernels
	In \cref{s:results} we observed that both the volume of the eigensphere and the anisotropy of the Gaussian component influenced the anisotropy of the kernels. To test which is of the two is responsible for the difference we introduce two new datasets; \anisotropyOne and \anisotropyTwo, with the same anisotropy but eigenspheres whose volumes differ. To create dataset \anisotropyOne the covarianceMatrix used in \ferdosiOne was replaced by $\diag([4, 3, 1]$, dataset \anisotropyTwo is the same as set \anisotropyOne but uses $3 \cdot \diag([4, 3, 1]$.

	%
	The \mses of the two estimators on dataset \anisotropyOne and \anisotropyTwo are shown in \cref{tab:discussion:anisotropy:mse}, clearly both estimators perform better on the dataset with higher values on the diagonal of the covariance matrix of the Gaussian component.
	% Influence of density on Anisotropy
	\Cref{fig:discussion:anisotropy:anisotropy} illustrates the influence of the volume of the eigensphere of the Gaussian component on the anisotropy of the kernels near the Gaussian component. \percentage{6.233289} of the points with a highly anisotropic kernel in dataset \anisotropyOne is sampled from the Gaussian component, in dataset \anisotropyTwo this is \percentage{4.161096}. Although the difference is small, it illustrates that the volume of the eigensphere of a component influences the anisotropy of the kernels.
