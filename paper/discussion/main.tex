This section discusses the results presented in \cref{s:results}. We consider the lack of difference in performance between the estimators in \cref{s:discussion:performance}. The next section discusses the anisotropy of the kernels used by the shape-adaptive estimators.

\todo[inline]{Suggest increasing K: which problems would that solve, discuss experiment with K10}
% Detection of fine spurious strucre in the noise, might also help with lack of anisotorpy high density areas. May be with some control parameter that depends on the local physical density.

\todo[inline]{Suggest not always using a shape-adaptive kernel, only if the local neighbourhood has an anistropy that is greater than x. Which problems might that solve?}
% Influence of the density of the gaussian. 
% Would not solve noise problems, as those areas clearly have a anisotorpy that is quite high.

\todo[inline]{Influence of density suggest on the performance of both estimators suggests that the local bandwidth computation is far from ideal}
