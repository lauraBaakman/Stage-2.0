This section discusses the results presented in \cref{s:results}. We consider the lack of difference in performance between the estimators in \cref{s:discussion:performance}. The next section discusses the anisotropy of the kernels used by the shape-adaptive estimators.

\todo[inline]{Suggest increasing K: which problems would that solve, discuss experiment with K10}
\todo[inline]{Suggest not always using a shape-adaptive kernel, only if the local neighbourhood has an anistropy that is greater than x. Which problems might that solve?}
