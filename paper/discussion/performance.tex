% Hardly any difference between estimators
	% Where are the differences largest -> plots
	% Suggest introducing a scaling factor to enhance the effect of the shape adaptive kernel
	% Suggest increasing K, what did ur small experiment with increasing K show?

% SAMBE gives higher densities than MBE, (over estimating in F1, B1, B4, B5; underestimating in F2, B2, F3, B4) why?
