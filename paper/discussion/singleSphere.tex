% Introduction
The scatter plots of the datasets with a single Gaussian in \cref{fig:discussion:singleSphere:mbeLowerError} emphasize the points where the absolute error of the symmetric estimator is smaller than that of the shape-adaptive estimator.

		% The overlay plot
		\Cref{fig:discussion:singleSphere:mbeLowerError:ferdosi1} shows that the shape-adaptive estimator results outperforms the symmetric estimators on most points near the boundary of the dataset. It also seems to illustrate that that \mbe results in a lower error than \sambe on the other points, however the raw data shows that on \percentage{5.272411257436994e+01} of the full dataset, and on \percentage{5.565750000000001e+01} of the Gaussian component the symmetric estimator results in a lower absolute error.
		% The shape of the kernels
		Reviewing the shape of the kernels used for the points in dataset \ferdosiOne we find that the used kernels are all near spherical. The kernels with the largest differences between their eigenvalues are associated with points near the boundary of the dataset. 
		% Largest differnces in estimated values between kernels. 
		The largest differences in error between the two estimators can be found near the mean of the Gaussian component, where the shape-adaptive kernels are relatively spherical. We think it likely that the difference between the two estimators at these points is caused by the difference in physical density at that location in the dataset, which ensures that a kernel that is slightly elliptical has a result that differs strongly from that of a spherical kernel. This is confirmed by the large differences in the number of patterns that are used in the density estimate of the points near the mean of the Gaussian component between the two estimators.

		% Overlay plot
		The results in \cref{fig:discussion:singleSphere:mbeLowerError:baakman1} are comparable to those in \cref{fig:experiment:singlesphere:ferdosi1}, however fewer points of the noise component seem to emphasized in the former. This would mean that the absolute error for most points of the noise component is lower when using symmetric kernels instead of shape-adaptive kernels. Reviewing the raw data shows that this difference is primarily caused by the \num{7.803000000000000e+03} points for which both estimators estimate the same density. We expect that this is due to the elongated shape of the distribution, as its shape influences the kernel of fewer points of the noise component, resulting in more spherical kernels, which causes the estimators to give the same estimate.
		% The shape of the kernels
		As in dataset \ferdosiOne the points with the most ellipsoidal kernels are positioned near the boundaries of the dataset, where \sambe outperforms \mbe. 
		% Largest differences in estiamted values between estimators
		The points whose differences in estimated densities are largest are, as in dataset \ferdosiOne, found near the mean of the Gaussian distribution. We hypothesize that this is occurs in this dataset for the same reason as it occurs in dataset \ferdosiOne.

		% Overlay Plot
		In \cref{fig:discussion:singleSphere:mbeLowerError:baakman4} we observe that the \mbe outperforms \sambe on very few points in dataset \baakmanFour, to be exact on \num{92.7051824965} percent of the points the absolute error of the shape-adaptive estimator was at least as low as that of the symmetric estimator. We expect that the effect of the Gaussian component is stronger than in dataset \baakmanOne since it is more elongated.
		% Shape of the kernels
		Reviewing the shape of the kernels we find kernels with large differences between their eigenvalues both near the boundary of the dataset, where \sambe outperforms \mbe, and near the Gaussian component. We expect that the last occurs in this dataset and not in set \baakmanOne due to how much more elongated the Gaussian component is. 
		% Largest differences in estimated values between estimators
		Near the mean of this component we also find the biggest differences in estimated densities between the two estimators.

		% Overlay plot
		The effect of how elongated the Gaussian component is on how well the density of the noise is estimated is stronger in dataset \baakmanFive, as illustrated in \cref{fig:discussion:singleSphere:mbeLowerError:baakman5}. The density estimate of the two estimates is the same for \percentage{9.540229885057471e+01} of the points drawn from the uniform distribution, contrastingly this is only the case for \percentage{5.575000000000000e+00} of the points from the Gaussian component. 
		% Shape of the Kernels
		As in dataset \baakmanFour the shape of the kernels is most strongly influenced by the data near the boundaries of the dataset and the Gaussian component.
		% Largest differences in estimated values between estimators
		The largest differences between the results of the two estimators are, comparable to what we observed in dataset \baakmanFour, found near the mean of the Gaussian component. 

% General observations 
% Strong difference in kernel shape near the Gaussian in baakman 4 and 5
In general we have found that if the Gaussian component is strongly elongated, as in dataset \baakmanFour and \baakmanFive, the shape of the kernels near the mean of the Gaussian component is influenced, whereas the spherical and ellipsoidal Gaussian component in dataset \ferdosiOne and \baakmanOne, respectively, hardly influences the shape of the kernels of the data points near its mean. We expect that this is caused by a lower physical density of points near the means of the more spherical Gaussians. 
% Strong difference in density estimate near the mean of the Gaussian in ferdosi 1, baakman 1, baakman 4, baakman 5
In spite of this difference between the four datasets, in all datasets the difference in estimated density between the estimators is largest near the mean of the Gaussian component. We expect that this is due to the relative high density of points at this location, which causes small differences in the shapes of the kernels to have a large effect on the final density.
