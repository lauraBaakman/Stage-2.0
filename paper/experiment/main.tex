We contrast the performance of the shape-adaptive and the symmetric Modified Breiman Estimator on simulated datasets with known density fields. This allows us to test how well the proposed method recovers simple density distributions in comparison to an existing method. The \mse (\MSE) is used to quantify the performance of the estimators. We distinguish two types of datasets: datasets consisting of a single Gaussian distribution and noise, defined in \cref{s:experiment:singlesphere} and datasets containing multiple Gaussian distributions embed in noise, these sets are presented in \cref{s:experiment:multisphere}.

\subsection{Datasets with Multiple Gaussians}

\textcite{ferdosi2011comparison} found that the Modified Breiman Estimator resulted in lower integrated squared errors if fewer Gaussian distributions were present in the datasets. Since the presented datasets are comparable to those used by \citeauthor{ferdosi2011comparison} we expect to find the same influence of the number of distributions on the error.
