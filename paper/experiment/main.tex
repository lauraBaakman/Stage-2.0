We compare the performance of the shape-adaptive method with that of the Modified Breiman Estimator, on simulated datasets with known density fields. This allows us to test how well the proposed method can recover simple density distributions. We distinguish two types of datasets: datasets consisting of a single Gaussian distribution and noise, discussed in \cref{s:experiment:singlesphere} and datasets containing multiple Gaussian distributions next to noise, these are presented in \cref{s:experiment:multisphere}.

To quantify the performance of the estimators we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE):
\begin{equation*}
	\varMSE{\varEstimatedDensityFunction{\bullet}} = \frac{1}{\varNumPatterns} \sum_{\itXs = 1}^{\varNumPatterns} {\left(\varEstimatedDensityFunction{\varPattern[\itXs]} - \varDensityFunction{\varPattern[\itXs]} \right)}^2.
\end{equation*}
