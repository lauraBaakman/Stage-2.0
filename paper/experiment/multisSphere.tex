%General
\Cref{tab:experiment:multisphere:sets} defines the datasets that consist of uniform random noise and multiple Gaussian distributions, a scatter plot representation of the sets is shown in \cref{fig:experiment:multisphere:sets}. 
	% Ferdosi 2
	Dataset \ferdosiTwo consists of two Gaussian distributions embedded in noise, the first Gaussian component is significantly denser than the second. The spheres are placed in such a way that they are unlikely to overlap. 
	% Baakman 2
	The procedure outlined in \cref{s:experiment:singlesphere} for the creation of dataset \baakmanOne was used to derive dataset \baakmanTwo from set \ferdosiTwo.
	% Ferdosi Three
	Dataset \ferdosiThree embeds four Gaussians, with eigenspheres with notably differencing radii in the uniform random back ground. It is unlikely that these distributions overlap due to their placement. 
	%Baakman 3
	The last dataset, \baakmanThree, is a variation on \ferdosiThree, created with method that was used for the definition of dataset \baakmanTwo from \baakmanOne.
