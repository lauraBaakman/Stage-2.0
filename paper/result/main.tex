This section presents the results of the experiments described in \cref{s:experiment}. 
%MSE
We compare the performance of the two estimators on each dataset with the \mse and visually with plots. 
% Plots
	% Axes
	All plots associated with a single dataset have the same domain and range, to allow for easy comparison of the results within a dataset. The horizontal axis is used to represent the known densities, its range is such that each known density can be shown. The estimated densities are shown on the vertical axis, the length of these axes is such that they are long enough to represent every estimated density for that dataset, independent of the used estimator. 
	% Perfect performance line
	The black line in each plot illustrates the line all points would lie on if a perfect estimator was used, \ie the line $x = x$.
	% Colors
	The colors of the points in these plot correspond to the colors of the elements of the datasets in \cref{tab:experiment:singlesphere:sets,tab:experiment:multisphere:sets}.

% Structure of the section
	\Cref{s:results:singleGaussian} presents the results of the datasets that contain a single Gaussian, in \cref{s:results:multipleGaussian} the results of the datasets that consist of noise and multiple Gaussian distributions are presented.

\subsection{Datasets with Multiple Gaussians}

%Some final general observation for all sets
\todo[inline]{Some observations that hold for both sets.}
By comparing the \mse of the different components of the datasets we have also found that both estimators are better at estimating the density of points sample from uniform random noise than points sampled from a Gaussian distribution.
