\Cref{tab:4:results:mse} presents the averages of the squares of the error of the shape-adaptive and non-shape-adaptive version of the Modified Breiman Estimator on the different datasets presented in \cref{tab:3:simulated:datasets}. Comparing the two columns in \cref{tab:4:results:mse} we find that the Modified Breiman Estimator outperforms the shape-adaptive estimator on every dataset. 

The differences in MSE between the two datasets on dataset \ferdosiOne is negligible. On dataset \ferdosiTwo, and \ferdosiFive, the performances of the estimators differ more, but the results are comparable. The biggest difference in performance between estimators is found when comparing the results of dataset \baakmanOne, \baakmanFour, and \baakmanFive.
