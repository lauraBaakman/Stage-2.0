% What does the section do
In this section we present the results of the two estimators on dataset \ferdosiTwo, \baakmanTwo, \ferdosiThree, and \baakmanThree.
% MSE

	Based on the small differences between the \mses of the estimators in \cref{tab:results:multiSphere:mse} the estimators perform comparably on these datasets.

	% FOCUS ON COMPONENTS
	Comparing the \MSE between components within the data sets between estimators yields no differences. However within data sets the difference in \mses are quite large.
	% FERDOSI 2 & BAAKMAN 2
	Within dataset \ferdosiTwo and \baakmanTwo both estimators perform significantly better on the more sparse component `Trivariate Gaussian 2'.
	% FERDOSI 3 & BAAKMAN 3
	Both estimators show the same positive correlation between the density of the Gaussian components and the \MSE between the components of dataset \ferdosiThree and \baakmanThree. Additionally contrary to our expectation both estimators performed slightly better on dataset \baakmanThree than on the set it was derived from.

	\Cref{fig:results:multiSphere:two:comparativePlots} shows the estimated density as a function of the known density for both estimators and both datasets with two Gaussians. These plots show that both estimators underestimate the density, \mbe more than \sambe. Furthermore the shape-adaptive estimator shows more variation in the densities it estimates than the symmetric estimator.

	% FOCUS ON COMPONENTS
		% SAMBE seems better on red comonent
		Comparing \cref{fig:results:multisphere:mbe:ferdosi2,fig:results:multisphere:mbe:baakman2} with \cref{fig:results:multisphere:sambe:ferdosi2,fig:results:multisphere:sambe:ferdosi2} suggest that \sambe hardly underestimates the densities of the most anisotropic component, \ie `Trivariate Gaussian 2' in bot dataset \ferdosiTwo and \baakmanTwo. However the difference in \mse of this component between \mbe and \sambe is pretty small, a large difference in standard deviation of the squared error suggests that the seemingly better performance of the shape-adaptive estimator in \cref{fig:results:multisphere:sambe:ferdosi2,fig:results:multisphere:sambe:ferdosi2} is mostly due to the higher spread of densities estimated by the shape-adaptive estimator. 
		% Better performance on 
		Furthermore the difference in \mse between components within estimators and dataset \ferdosiTwo and \baakmanTwo shows that both estimators perform worse on the denser Gaussian component, \ie `Trivariate Gaussian 1'.

	The plots in \cref{fig:results:multiSphere:three:comparativePlots} confirm the large difference in performance of both estimators between datasets with two and four Gaussian components. Moreover they show that both \mbe and \sambe underestimate densities, especially on the points with a high density. \Cref{fig:results:multiSphere:three:comparativePlots} also shows that the spread of the densities estimated by \sambe is higher than of those estimated by \mbe.

		\label{tab:results:multiSphere:anisotropy}
	\end{table*}
	% What are we looking at
	\Cref{tab:results:multiSphere:anisotropy} presents the mean and standard deviation of the anisotropy of the kernels used for the points from dataset \ferdosiTwo through \baakmanThree and from their components. 
	% Small differences in anisotropy between F2/F3 and B2/B3
	Although the anisotropy of the kernels used for the datasets with anisotropic Gaussian components is higher on average and more varied than the anisotropy of the kernels used for dataset \ferdosiTwo and \ferdosiThree, the differences are small. 
	% Noise has largest anisotropy
	As in \cref{tab:results:singleSphere:anisotropy} the kernels associated with the points sampled from the component `Uniform random background` have the highest anisotropy, and vary the most in how anisotropic they are. 
	% Positve correlation between mean anisotropy of the kernels and anisotropy of the gaussian components.
	Contrasting the mean anisotropy of the kernels used for points drawn from the different components we find a positive correlation between the mean anisotropy of the kernel and the anisotropy of the Gaussian components. 
	% Positive correlation between anisotropy SD and kernel anisotropy
		% exists for B2
		In the kernels used for dataset \baakmanTwo we observe the same positive correlation between the variation of the anisotropy of the kernels and the anisotropy of the associated kernel as we observed in dataset \baakmanOne, \baakmanFour, and \baakmanFive. 
		% does not occur in B3
		Comparing the standard deviation of the anisotropy of the kernels used for the points sampled from the components of dataset \baakmanThree does not reveal this relation: the densest component, Trivariate Gaussian 3, does not have the highest variation in kernel anisotropy. 
	% ANISOTROPY OF M3 and M4 seems equal for Gaussian 3, is that really the case? 
	One thing that stands out when comparing dataset \ferdosiThree and \baakmanThree in \cref{tab:results:multiSphere:anisotropy} is the lack of difference in the mean and standard deviation in the anisotropy of the kernels associated with the component `Trivariate Gaussian 3'. Reviewing the raw data reveals that the largest difference in anisotropy between any point drawn from that component is \num{3.108624e-15}.

% SUMMARY/CONCLUSION
	% Small differences in MSE between the two datasets
	To summarize the results of the datasets with multiple Gaussian components: we have found that the differences in performance are very small between the two estimators, although \sambe underestimates less than \mbe, the later performs slightly better.
	% Both estimators perform better on denser gaussian components
	Furthermore both estimators show a positive correlation between the density of the Gaussian component and their performance on that component.
	% Differences in anisotropy of the kernels between the F1/F2 and B1/B2 are small. 
	Regarding the anisotropy of the kernels we have found only a small increase between dataset with spherical kernels and dataset \baakmanTwo and \baakmanThree. 
	% Anisotropy is storngest on noise component
	Zeroing in on the components we have observed that the anisotropy of kernels associated with points drawn from the noise is strongest.
	% Positve correlation between mean anisotropy of kernels and anisotropy of the gaussian comonent
	Lastly a positive correlation between the mean anisotropy of the kernels of the points sampled from a component and the anisotropy of the Gaussian those points were drawn from was found.
