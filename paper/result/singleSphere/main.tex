This section compares the performance of the Modified Breiman Estimator with symmetric and shape-adaptive kernels on data sets that contain one Gaussian component.

	\end{table}

	Comparing the \mses of the \mbe with those of \sambe in \cref{tab:results:singleSphere:mse} we find that the estimators perform comparably, but that the fixed-shape estimator consistently gives a slightly lower \mse.

	This is confirmed by the visualization of the results in \cref{fig:results:singleSphere:comparativePlots} where hardly any difference is visible between \cref{fig:results:singlesphere:mbe:ferdosi1,fig:results:singlesphere:mbe:baakman1,fig:results:singlesphere:mbe:baakman4,fig:results:singlesphere:mbe:baakman5}, and \cref{fig:results:singlesphere:sambe:ferdosi1,fig:results:singlesphere:sambe:baakman1,fig:results:singlesphere:sambe:baakman4,fig:results:singlesphere:sambe:baakman5}, respectively. 
		%Ferdosi 1
		Comparing the plots associated with data set \ferdosiOne, we find that the shape-adaptive estimator tends to overestimate densities more than the symmetric estimator if the Gaussian component is spherical.
		% Baakman 4
		Based on \cref{fig:results:singlesphere:mbe:baakman4,fig:results:singlesphere:sambe:baakman4} the same holds for set \baakmanFour. 
	% Focus on components
	Comparing the performance within data sets between the two components showed no marked differences between the estimators between components.

	% General
	\Cref{tab:results:singleSphere:anisotropy} presents the mean and the standard deviation of the anisotropy of the kernels used for the different data sets. Comparing the means we find a positive correlation between the anisotropy of the Gaussian component of the data set and mean anisotropy of the kernels. The same positive correlation can be observed for the standard deviation. Furthermore as the anisotropy of the Gaussian component increases, the anisotropy of the kernels associated with points sampled from the uniform random background rises.
	% Focus on components
	Reviewing these statistics of the components of the data sets reveals that the increase in average anisotropy is primarily caused by an increase in anisotropy of kernels of points sampled from the Gaussian component. The mean anisotropy of the noise component stays relatively constant. Furthermore as the Gaussian component is more anisotropic the variation in anisotropy of the kernels increases.

%Summary
To summarize; in spite of differences in anisotropy of the used kernels we have observed very few differences between the two estimators. Using shape-adaptive kernels did not yield the expected gain in performance. We did find the expected influence of the anisotropy of the Gaussian components on the shape of the kernels. Furthermore the kernels associated with points sampled from the background are more anisotropic than those belonging to points drawn from the Gaussian distribution.
